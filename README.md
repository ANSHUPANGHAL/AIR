The Air Pollution Indexing project is a web-based application that provides real-time air quality information for a given location. By utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, the application fetches data related to various air pollutants and calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI is a numerical representation of air quality, ranging from "Good" to "Very Poor," helping users understand the environmental conditions in their area.
